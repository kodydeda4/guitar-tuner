# About

GuitarTuner is a cross-platform, native application, written purely in SwiftUI.  It was created to show how modern tools such as SwiftUI, Combine, Swift Package Manager and the ComposableArchitecture can be used to create modular, flexible apps.

## Architecture

### SwiftUI

SwiftUI helps you build great-looking apps across all Apple platforms with the power of Swift â€” and as little code as possible. With SwiftUI, you can bring even better experiences to all users, on any Apple device, using just one set of tools and APIs.

### Swift Package Manager

SPM allows us to easily create, remove, add, and share code without it needing to live directly inside the project itself, making them extremely useful in maintaining a modular codebase, especially if the packages are split further into individual sources.

Here are some of the benefits of using SPM:

1. Strongly enforces what code is made public/private.
2. Feature logic becomes isolated & maintained.
3. Platform Independent
4. Previews run faster because xcode doesn't have to run the entire application.
5. Dependencies can be easily identified and managed.
6. Importing/removing libraries is easy.

### ComposableArchitecture

The Composable Architecture (TCA, for short) is a library for building applications in a consistent and understandable way, with composition, testing, and ergonomics in mind. This library provides a few core tools that can be used to build applications of varying purpose and complexity. It provides compelling stories that you can follow to solve many problems you encounter day-to-day when building applications.
